# CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW / EXISTING SYSTEMS

This chapter provides an analysis of the existing landscape of digital cooking solutions, including popular recipe websites, mobile applications, and AI-powered assistants. It examines their strengths and weaknesses to identify key innovation opportunities that Savora is uniquely positioned to address.

## 2.1 OVERVIEW OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS

The digital culinary space is mature, with solutions generally falling into two main categories: content-rich recipe repositories and hands-free voice assistants.

#### 2.1.1 Websites and Apps with Recipe Navigation

This is the most established category, dominated by platforms like **Allrecipes, Epicurious, Tasty, and Food Network**. These services act as vast digital cookbooks.

*   **Core Functionality:** Their primary function is to provide a large, searchable database of recipes. Users can filter by ingredients, cuisine, dietary restrictions, and prep time.
*   **User Interaction:** They heavily rely on user-generated content, particularly ratings and reviews, which serve as a quality filter for other users. Many also feature meal planning calendars where users can manually drag and drop recipes.
*   **Monetization:** Typically, these platforms are monetized through display advertising, affiliate links for groceries/equipment, and premium subscriptions for ad-free experiences or exclusive content.

While highly useful for finding recipes, these platforms are fundamentally static. The user's interaction ends once they've selected a recipe; the actual cooking process is offline and unassisted.

#### 2.1.2 AI-Based Cooking Assistants

This category includes voice-first platforms like **Amazon Alexa (with Food Network or Allrecipes skills) and Google Assistant**. Their primary value proposition is hands-free operation in the kitchen.

*   **Core Functionality:** These assistants can read recipe steps aloud, set timers, and answer basic conversion questions (e.g., "How many tablespoons in a quarter cup?").
*   **User Interaction:** Interaction is entirely through voice commands. Users can ask the assistant to start cooking, move to the next step, repeat a step, or set a timer for a specific duration mentioned in the instructions.
*   **Limitations:** These assistants are essentially screen readers for recipes. They lack true conversational ability, cannot handle out-of-scope questions (e.g., "My sauce is too thin, what should I do?"), and have no understanding of the cooking context beyond the text of the current step.

## 2.2 COMPARATIVE FEATURE ANALYSIS

To better understand Savora's position, we can compare its feature set against these existing paradigms.

#### 2.2.1 Strengths of Existing Platforms

*   **Traditional Recipe Apps** excel at content volume and discovery. Their massive libraries and user review systems create a reliable resource for finding a recipe for almost any occasion.
*   **AI Cooking Assistants** have successfully solved the "hands-free" problem, allowing users to follow recipes without touching a screen, which is invaluable in a messy kitchen environment.

#### 2.2.2 Weaknesses and Gaps

Despite their strengths, both models leave significant gaps in the user experience:

1.  **Lack of Dynamic Interaction:** Recipe websites are static. Voice assistants are rigid; they can't deviate from the script. There is no system that actively assists with the *process* of cooking.
2.  **Impersonal Experience:** Suggestions are based on ingredients, not context. A user feeling sad and a user feeling energetic are shown the same recipes if they both search for "pasta."
3.  **Manual Cognitive Load:** Users are still responsible for manually scaling ingredients for different serving sizes, parsing their shopping list from an ingredient list, and keeping track of multiple timers.
4.  **Shallow Community Engagement:** While user reviews are common, they don't foster a true sense of community. Engagement is limited to a one-time comment rather than ongoing interaction, recognition, and sharing.

## 2.3 INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES

The identified gaps highlight clear needs that Savora is built to address. Savora's strategy is to merge the content-rich nature of recipe websites with a truly intelligent, interactive AI core.

#### 2.3.1 Identified Needs

1.  **Emotional and Contextual Guidance:** Users need a system that understands not just *what* they want to cook, but *why*.
2.  **Interactive Cooking Assistance:** Users need a tool that doesn't just read instructions but helps manage the process with integrated tools like timers.
3.  **Intelligent Automation of Tedious Tasks:** Scaling recipes and creating shopping lists are time-consuming and error-prone. This process should be automated.
4.  **Deeper Community Connection:** Users desire a more engaging community model that encourages sharing, offers recognition, and builds a sense of belonging.

#### 2.3.2 How Savora Improves Upon Them

Savora directly targets these needs with its unique feature set, bridging the gap between passive recipe browsing and active, intelligent cooking assistance.
