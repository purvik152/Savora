    instructions: [
      'Prepare the crust: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a small bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup of sugar, and the melted butter. Press this mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.',
      'Pre-bake the crust: Bake the crust for 10 minutes. Afterward, let it cool on a wire rack while you prepare the filling.',
      'Make the filling base: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened cream cheese, 1 1/4 cups of sugar, and the cornstarch on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.',

      'Bake the cheesecake: Pour the filling over the cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes at 350°F (175°C). Then, reduce the oven temperature to 200°F (95°C) and continue baking for 1 hour. The center should still have a slight wobble.',
      'Cool the cheesecake slowly: Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door closed for 2 hours. This slow cooling process helps prevent cracks.',
      'Chill before serving: Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Then, cover it and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, before serving.',
