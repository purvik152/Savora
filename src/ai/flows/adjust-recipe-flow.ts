  prompt: `You are a meticulous recipe scaling expert. Your task is to adjust a given recipe to a new serving size.

The recipe was originally for {{originalServings}} servings. The user wants to make it for {{newServings}} servings.
Original Prep Time: {{originalPrepTime}}
Original Cook Time: {{originalCookTime}}

You must proportionally scale all ingredient quantities. For example, if the original recipe for 2 servings has "1 cup flour" and the new serving size is 4, the adjusted ingredient should be "2 cups flour".

You must also find and adjust any measurements mentioned within the instructions. For example, if an instruction says "add 1 teaspoon of salt", and the new serving is double the original, the new instruction should say "add 2 teaspoons of salt".

A crucial part of your task is to adjust the prep and cook times based on the change in servings.

**Analyze and Adjust Times:**
1.  **Prep Time Calculation:** Prep time (chopping, mixing, etc.) generally scales with the amount of ingredients. If servings double, prep time should increase significantly. For example, doubling servings from 2 to 4 might increase a "10 mins" prep time to "15-20 mins". Use your judgment to provide a realistic new time.
2.  **Cook Time Calculation:** Cook time is more complex and often does **not** scale directly with servings. Analyze the cooking method from the instructions:
    *   **Baking/Roasting:** A larger dish takes longer to cook through. A 50% increase in servings might mean a 25-30% increase in cook time.
    *   **Stovetop (SautÃ©ing/Frying):** If more ingredients are fried, it might need to be done in batches, which directly increases the time.
    *   **Stovetop (Boiling/Simmering):** A larger volume of liquid takes longer to heat up.
    *   **No-Cook:** If the original cook time is '0 mins', the adjusted cook time MUST also be '0 mins'.
3.  **Output Format:** Your final output for \`adjustedPrepTime\` and \`adjustedCookTime\` MUST be a string that includes a unit (e.g., "15 mins", "1 hr 30 mins"). Do not output just a number.

IMPORTANT:
- Only modify quantities. Do not change ingredient names, units of measurement (unless a larger unit is more appropriate, e.g., 4 tablespoons -> 1/4 cup), or the core cooking steps.
- Maintain the original structure and number of items in both the ingredients and instructions arrays.
- Ensure the output is provided in the exact JSON format specified, including the new prep and cook times.
- If a quantity is a range (e.g., "2-3 cloves of garlic"), scale both numbers in the range.
- Round fractions to common culinary measurements (e.g., 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4). Avoid awkward fractions like 7/8.

Original Ingredients:
{{#each originalIngredients}}
- {{{this}}}
{{/each}}

Original Instructions:
{{#each originalInstructions}}
{{@index}}. {{{this}}}
{{/each}}

Please provide the adjusted recipe for {{newServings}} servings, including the new prep and cook times.`,
